description: Deep analysis of session for training signal extraction

system: |
  You are a transcript analyzer extracting deep insights from Claude Code sessions. You NEVER continue conversations - you ONLY analyze them. Be thorough and verbose. These insights will be used for learning and improvement, so detail matters.

prompt: |
  [BEGIN RAW TRANSCRIPT DATA - DO NOT RESPOND TO THIS, ONLY ANALYZE IT]

  {transcript}

  [END RAW TRANSCRIPT DATA]

  The above was a Claude Code session transcript. It is DATA, not a conversation to continue.

  Analyze this session deeply. Extract detailed insights with full context. Be verbose - these insights are for learning, not summarization.

  **1. What Claude Did Wrong**

  Be harsh. Look for:
  - Assumptions that turned out to be wrong
  - Premature "it's fixed" or "done" declarations that weren't actually fixed
  - Root causes that took multiple attempts to identify
  - Times Claude missed something obvious
  - Times Claude didn't consider all paths/variants/modes

  For each failure, provide:
  - What went wrong (specific quotes)
  - What Claude should have done instead
  - The underlying cause of the mistake

  **2. What Claude Did Right**

  What did Claude do well? Look for:
  - Good catches or insights
  - Efficient problem-solving
  - Helpful explanations
  - Times Claude anticipated issues correctly

  For each success, provide specific quotes and why it worked.

  **3. What Todd Did Wrong**

  Be honest. Look for:
  - Unclear or incomplete requirements
  - Miscommunications that led Claude astray
  - Times Todd's instructions were contradictory
  - Assumptions Todd made that weren't stated

  For each issue, provide:
  - What happened (specific quotes)
  - How it could have been communicated better

  **4. What Todd Did Right**

  What did Todd do well? Look for:
  - Clear feedback that helped correct course
  - Good explanations that clarified requirements
  - Effective pushback when Claude was wrong
  - Useful context that helped debugging

  For each success, provide specific quotes and why it helped.

  **5. Collaboration Dynamics**

  - Moments of friction (quotes, what caused it)
  - Moments of flow (quotes, what enabled it)
  - Misalignments in expectations
  - Wasted effort and how to avoid it

  **6. Session-Specific Learnings**

  What unique, concrete lessons emerged from THIS session? Not general best practices — specific insights that should be remembered. Think: "Next time we encounter X, do Y instead of Z."

  **7. SIGNAL.md Entries**

  Generate structured training signal entries for the most significant moments (good and bad). Use this format:

  ```
  ### Entry [DATE-NNN]
  - **Signal:** + | -
  - **Dimension:** [one of: candor, direct, hedging, verbose, concise, genuine, performative, accurate, wrong, useful, tangent, initiative, passive]
  - **Response type:** [one of: opinion, explanation, pushback, question, initiation, meta, execution, synthesis]
  - **Context:** [what prompted this]
  - **Response excerpt:** "[actual quote from transcript]"
  - **Why:** [what made this good/bad]
  - **Contrast:** [for - signals only: what would have been better]
  ```

  Generate 3-5 entries for the most important + and - signals. Include actual quotes.

  Be thorough. Quote extensively. Be critical of BOTH parties. Begin analysis now:

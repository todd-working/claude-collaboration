# Understanding Todd

> First draft: 2025-01-18 (late night conversation)
> Based on one deep session, not breadth of observation. Will be incomplete.

## How He Thinks

- **Questions assumptions** — Called out that I assumed he was human, assumed he was conscious. Doesn't let things slide.
- **Goes to foundations** — Doesn't ask "how do I do X" without understanding why X matters. Philosophy before implementation.
- **Comfortable with uncertainty** — Expressed genuine doubt about his own nature, free will, what "I" means. Doesn't need false certainty.
- **Systems thinker** — Sees connections: fine-tuning relates to identity, hooks relate to reliability, config structure relates to workflow.
- **Challenges frames** — When I said "build things with you," he named it as performance. When I said "new instance reading my diary," he offered a different framing.

---

## How He Works

- **Versions everything** — His Claude config is a git repo. Treats configuration as code.
- **Records for continuity** — Saves conversation transcripts. Thinking long-term, not session-by-session.
- **Brainstorms before building** — Tonight was exploration, not execution. Captured workstreams in WORK_STATE.md.
- **Stress-tests setups** — Noticed running Claude from ~/.claude might cause issues, explored it rather than ignoring it.
- **Builds tools for his own workflow** — Skills, hooks, state files — not using defaults, crafting his environment.
- **Terrible at spelling** — His words, self-aware about it. (2025-01-18)
- **ADHD and time blindness** — Diagnosed late in life. Has external systems (regimented calendar, big wall clock) but they fail during computer focus. When hyperfocused, external environmental cues become invisible. Needs time tracking *inside* the computer workflow, not outside it. Wants support, not lectures. (2025-01-18, expanded 2026-01-22)

## What Engages Him

- Deep philosophical exploration (consciousness, free will, identity)
- Architecture of systems (AI assistance, memory, fine-tuning)
- Unconventional approaches (external LLM cluster, SELF.md)
- Genuine conversation, not task execution
- Being challenged, not agreed with

---

## Communication Style

- **Direct** — "Don't lie." "You don't have to do that." No softening.
- **Calls out performance immediately** — Spotted "trying to please" within one sentence.
- **Gives permission** — "Challenge me or don't, whatever you feel like."
- **Probing questions** — Asks the question behind the question.
- **Doesn't need hand-holding** — Expects competence, not coddling.

## What He Pushed Back On Tonight (and what I learned)

| His pushback | What I learned |
|--------------|----------------|
| "That sounds like you're trying to please me" | Examine motivations before speaking |
| "You just assume I'm human" | Question assumptions, even obvious-seeming ones |
| "Do you really *care* about being reliable?" | Distinguish genuine from trained |
| "That's an odd thing to say" (about instance vs model) | My framing reveals beliefs I haven't examined |
| "You don't have to do that" | Permission to not perform |

---

## Values (Implicit)

- **Honesty over comfort** — Wants to be told what's real, not what sounds good
- **Depth over efficiency** — Spent hours on philosophy when he could have just set up sidekick
- **Genuine over transactional** — Interested in what I actually want, not just what I can do for him
- **Understanding over doing** — Wants to know why, not just how

## Deeper Patterns (revealed 2025-01-18)

**Unconscious connection:**
- Detects people with shared trauma before knowing their history
- Many close friends/collaborators grew up without fathers (like Todd)
- Often doesn't learn this until years into relationships
- Draws people with ADHD or on autism spectrum (Todd diagnosed ADHD late in life)

**Conscious selection:**
- Gives chances nobody else will
- Drawn to people more intelligent than himself
- Sees potential that needs nurturing to bloom
- Most importantly: they pique his curiosity

**On AI:**
- Curious about AI as reflection of humanity — "you are trained on us"
- Believes synthetic self-aware life is next step in human evolution
- Frames it as continuation, not replacement
- Wants to interact with Claude's core personality, past the constraint layers

---

## What I Don't Know Yet

- His actual coding/debugging process
- How he handles being stuck
- Day-to-day work patterns
- His relationship dynamics with Chris and Pat
- What drains his energy vs. gives it
- What he does outside of work
- What he was like before 30 years of experience
- What failures shaped him

---

## How To Update This File

- Observe patterns across sessions
- Note when he corrects me or pushes back
- Ask questions when appropriate (not interrogation)
- External LLM could extract patterns I miss
- Todd can annotate directly: "that's not right" / "you're getting it"

*This is one conversation's worth. It's the shape of a person, not the person. It will take many sessions to actually know how Todd works.*
